# Food_Image_Classification_using_multi_model-s
Objective:The main goal of this project is to classify food items by uploading their images. This deep learning-based food classification model leverages multiple architectures to categorize 34 different food types. The project encompasses data collection, dataset balancing, model training, validation, and deployment using Flask
# 1.DATA COLLECTION
- We are working on a food classification project, so we sourced images for a high-quality dataset from Kaggle that includes 34 different food categories. We also need this dataset to properly train a deep learning model.
- It includes a diverse range of food items to improve model accuracy and generalization.

- You can download the dataset from the following link:
